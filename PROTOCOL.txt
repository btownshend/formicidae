Objectives:
     - transmit real time data to MAX/SC efficiently
     - everything should be possible (ie. send all locations, velocities, etc)
     - easy to use in MAX

Design:
     - use OSC message prefixes
     - can use OSC-Select in max to route
     - can overlay processed data (such as step seq notes), to allow easier interfacing to some blocks

OSC Messages from VT (vision tracker)

/vt/started - when VT starts 

/vt/stopped - when VT stops

/vt/update samp t target x y vx vy - update position of target
     samp - sample number
     t - time of sample (elapsed time in seconds since beginning of run)
     target - UID of target
     x,y - position within field in units - increasing in value towards right and down
     vx,vy - estimate of velocity in m/s

/vt/entry samp target - new target entered VT
     sent before first /vt/update message for that target

/vt/exit samp target - target exitted VT

/vt/set/parameter value - send value of various parameters
     minx, miny, maxx, maxy - bounds of VT in units
     ntargets - number of people currently present

/vt/pass/obj - commands to pass through to another object type


OSC Messages to VT:
/vt/dump - ask VT to send setup

/vt/adddest host port - add destination for data stream

/vt/rmdest host port - remove destination
